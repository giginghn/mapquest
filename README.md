# mapquest

In this project, I describe a trip taken between a sequence of locations. The goal is to travel from the first location to the second, then from the second location to the third, and
so on, until reaching the last location. Based on the user's input, it will show diferent information about the trip, such as turn-by-turn directions, distances and times, etc.

I used the Open MapQuest API to scrape the web data and created the function for my program.
